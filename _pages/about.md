I'm a PhD Candidate in economics at the [Department of Economics](https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html) at the University of Bern. 

My research interests are in the field of Applied Microeconomics. My primary research field is Labor Economics where I focus on concentration, wage inequality and monopsony power of firms.
