## Working Papers

### [Product Market Concentration, Wage Inequality and Worker Sorting](https://github.com/leyla-gilgen/leyla-gilgen.github.io/blob/master/files/Concentration_France.pdf) (with [Matias Cortes](https://sites.google.com/site/gmatiascortes/) and [Jeanne Tschopp](https://jtschopp.com))
<blockquote>
  <p>
Product markets have become increasingly dominated by a smaller number of firms with high market shares. At the same time, wage dispersion between firms has been increasing. In this paper, we show that product market concentration is associated with higher wage dispersion between firms within industries. Using rich administrative data from France covering the near-universe of workers and firms over the period 2009-2019, we find a positive and statistically significant correlation between sectoral concentration and different measures of between-firm wage inequality. The relationship is driven by (i) increased sorting of workers in high-paying occupations towards more productive firms within industries, and (ii) higher wage differentials between more and less productive firms in more concentrated industries, even conditional on their workers’ occupations. In a model that features wage heterogeneity between firms, a shock to consumer price sensitivity – which has been posited by Autor et al. (2020) as a driver of the rise in product market concentration – generates predictions that are consistent with the empirical patterns that we document.

### Monopoly or Monopsony? Labor Market Effects of Mergers and Acquisitions
<blockquote>
  <p>
Labor market effects of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) have become a widely discussed topic both among academics and policymakers. In this paper, I show the effects of mergers and acquisitions on labor market outcomes over the period 2009 - 2020 in France. I estimate an event study framework using matched employer-employee data covering the near-universe of French workers and firms. I find that after an M&A event, sales and employment within M&A firms decrease but I do not find any significant effect on wages, except for an increase in the first year after an M&A event. However, compositional changes play an important role and are driven by an increase in the share of workers in abstract occupations. Moreover, I find evidence for higher wage markdowns if both the buyer and the target firm are within the same labor market zone, suggesting that M&A events may increase the market power of firms in the labor market.
